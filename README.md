How Our Application Works?

STEP 1: We click the +(add) button on the top right side of the application to add a reminder.

STEP 2: Clicking the + button takes us to the another page where we put the content of our reminder and we also select the 
	date and time we want to remind ourself.
  
STEP 3: After we select desired date and put our desired content for reminder, we click save. It takes us back to the
	first page where there will be a list(tableView) of all the reminders we have.
  
STEP 4: To delete a reminder, left swipe the content in the list and press 'Delete'.

STEP 5: To get out of the application, Press 'Cancel' button on the top left of the screen.


NOTE: We have made our application with the help of google. Because of that, we need to change the swift version in XCode. 
	But, we are using school's PC and we cannot download anything on these PC's without administer permission.
	Please help us with that.
